/**@defgroup SymmetryLists Symmetry handling
   @ingroup DataLibrary 
    The symmetry lists are, simply, lists of 2D matrices. It's the way of
    taking symmetry into account in the reconstruction programs. The
    symmetry list must contain matrices which express equivalent views to
    the actual one due to the underlying volume symmetry. The identity matrix
    is not within the list. You know that symmetry matrices should form
    a subgroup, when reading a file the subgroup is automatically computed
    and, when you add or remove a new matrix, the subgroup must be
    manually computed.

/** Symmetry List class.
    Internally the symmetry list class is implemented as a single 2D matrix,
    where every 4 rows (remember that in 3D the geometrical transformation
    matrices are 4x4) comprise a symmetry matrix. Access, and ways to modify
    the symmetry list are supplied. Remind that any symmetry is expressed
    in terms of two matrices L and R, so that any Euler matrix must be
    transformed by L*Euler*R resulting into a new perspective of the volume
    which is equivalent to the original one.

    The typical use of the symmetry lists is to read the symmetry file, and
    do nothing else but reading matrices from it.

    The symmetry file format is
    @code
    #This is a comment
    # The following line is a 6-fold rotational symmetry axis along Z-axis.
    # The fold is the number of times that the volume can be rotated along
    # the symmetry axis giving the same view from different view points.
    # the structure for the rotational axis is
    # rot_axis      <fold> <X0> <Y0> <Z0>
    # mirror_plane         <X0> <Y0> <Z0>
